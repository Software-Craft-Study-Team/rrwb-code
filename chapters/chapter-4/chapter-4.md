## Chapter 4 - Refactoring Practice

### Read Other Books
Highly recommends reading **Refactoring, Ruby Edition**

### Practice Refactoring
- Build refactoring into your routine
  - Important, especially for teams that don't practice it by default.  
  - Sometimes we look at our own a week later, see smells and refactor it. It's a good sign though.
- Build testing into your routine
  - Talks about the "Don't fix it if it ain't broke" attitude. This is a hard thing to get around when the code doesn't have tests.
- Take small steps
  - Sometimes you discover a new direction/solution after taking a few very small steps, which you may have not discovered if you made the big change directly.
  - GeePawHill's articles about using small steps - https://www.geepawhill.org/series/many-more-much-smaller-steps/
- Get help from others
  - Pair programming always helps to get feedback  
  - Karthik's blog post about pair programming vs PR reviews - https://andkarthik.com/posts/pair-programming-vs
  - Andrzej & Julie spoke about doing in-depth code reviews which is super helpful 
- Add to the refactoring catalog
  - Confirms with the way Christopher Alexander talks about patterns and creating a pattern language for each project.
