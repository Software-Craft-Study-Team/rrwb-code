### Book questions:

A. Justify each of Beck’s rules for simple design.

Kent Beck Simple Design:
1. Passes all the tests. (self explanatory, it serves as safety net)
2. Communicates every intention important to the programmers. (we spend more time on understanding code than writing, it makes it easier to change when we understand the code)
3. Has no duplication of code, or of logic, or of knowledge. (diverge problem, come up with same concepts across the team)
4. Contains no unnecessary code.

B. Why are these rules in priority order? Can you find an example where communication overrides avoidance of duplication?
