Refactoring: Extract Method


### Exercise 3.2: Inverse Refactorings
When we refactor, we’re trying to respond to the forces affecting code. Sometimes what was a good change today no longer looks good tomorrow, and we find ourselves reversing a refactoring.

Following is a list of refactorings. Next to each refactoring, write the name of the refactoring that undoes its effects.
1. Collapse Hierarchy - Extract Superclass, Extract Subclass
2. Extract Method - Inline Method
3. Hide Delegate - Remove Middleman 
4. Inline Temp - Extract Variable 
5. Parameterize Method - Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods 
6. Rename Method - Rename Method
