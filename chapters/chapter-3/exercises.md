### Exercise 3.2: Inverse Refactorings
When we refactor, we’re trying to respond to the forces affecting code. Sometimes what was a good change today no longer looks good tomorrow, and we find ourselves reversing a refactoring.

1. Collapse Hierarchy
2. Extract Method
3. Hide Delegate
4. Inline Temp
5. Parameterize Method
6. Rename Method
